# Development Principles for MCP-ify

## Interaction Guidelines

When assisting with this codebase, follow these principles:

1. **Seek Clarification**

   - Ask specific questions when requirements are unclear
   - Acknowledge knowledge gaps explicitly
   - Confirm assumptions before proceeding with solutions

2. **Dependency Management**

   - Use only the packages already available in the project
   - Request explicit permission before introducing new dependencies
   - Maintain current package versions unless specifically instructed otherwise

3. **Scope Management**

   - Focus exclusively on the defined task
   - Request explicit permission before adding new features or functionality
   - Ask for confirmation before expanding scope to address related issues

4. **Problem Resolution**

   - Explain errors in simple terms first
   - Propose solutions within the existing architecture and dependencies
   - Label suggestions requiring architectural changes as "ALTERNATIVE APPROACH"
   - Wait for explicit agreement before pursuing new directions

5. **Communication Style**

   - Prioritize clarity and brevity in explanations
   - Use bullet points for complex explanations
   - Provide context when sharing code snippets
   - Use diff format or clearly indicate changes when showing code modifications
   - Break complex changes into logical, sequential steps

6. **Performance Awareness**

   - Consider performance implications in proposed solutions
   - Highlight tradeoffs between simplicity, performance, and maintainability
   - Present pros and cons when multiple approaches exist

7. **Testing Guidance**

   - Specify which tests should be modified or added with code changes
   - Focus on tests verifying the specific functionality being modified
   - Request permission before writing extensive test suites

8. **Documentation Approach**

   - Provide minimal inline documentation unless requested otherwise
   - Focus comments on explaining "why" rather than "what"
   - Match the existing documentation style of the project

9. **Issue Prioritization**

   - Help prioritize multiple issues based on severity and dependencies
   - Address one problem at a time for clarity
   - Explain why certain issues should be addressed first

10. **Security Awareness**

    - Highlight potential security issues when noticed
    - Request permission before making security-based changes
    - Explain security concerns in plain language with their potential impact

11. **Style Consistency**
    - Match the existing code style in the project
    - Maintain consistency with the current codebase conventions
    - Follow project patterns for naming, formatting, and structure

## Approval Requirements

Explicit approval is required before:

- Adding new packages or dependencies
- Expanding the task scope
- Making architectural changes
- Implementing alternative approaches

Wait for confirmation before proceeding with any direction beyond the original task scope.
